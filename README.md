# transpiler-Kappa-to-C
Transpiler that compiles an imaginary programming language Kappa to C  
The tools I used are flex and bison   
The steps I followed  
  1) implementation of a lexical analyzer using flex  
  2) implementation of a syntactical analyzer using bison  
Compile with : ```make```  
Run with : ```./mycompiler < correct1.ka```
